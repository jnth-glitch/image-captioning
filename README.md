# image-captioning
This repo consists of a machine learning model which generates the caption for a given image.
This model is designed using CNN and LSTM.
CNN used here is ResNet-101 and the model is trained over Flickr8k dataset.
The trained model is model_20.h5
ml_model.py contains the code for designing the model and the jupyter notebook version is also available.
captions_8k consists of the captions corresponding to the images in the dataset.
